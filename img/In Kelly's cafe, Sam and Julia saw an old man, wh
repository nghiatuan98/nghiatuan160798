 In Kelly's cafe, Sam and Julia saw an old man, who was grumpy. He asked the brown bread but they were no longer. It's only white ones. Then, he asked for sandwiches with white bread, cheese and ham. Ham and cheese were not accepted. It's hard to please this guy and it took a lot of time too. So Julia went to the next store and got two sandwiches for both and they left.
   While together in the park, Sam got a message. It was a photo of a pretty woman and a boy include. The boy liked Samm very much, the same hair, eyes... so Julia seemed jealous a little bit. She thought the boy was Samm's son. Luckily, she asked him and he said that Gavin-the boy was his nephew. It's a good sound to her and both of them were relieved.
  A few days later, they dated at the cinema. Julia was 35 minutes late so they had to change the film to watch. The Zombie Attack movie started at the good time but they are both didn't like the horror film. Finally, they decided to watch a comedy film named My Brother's Wedding. It ended at ten to eight and they took some coffee before home.
  	 Sammy wanted Julia to visit his old friend that evening for dinner. His name was Tony. Tony was Sam's teacher and he had retired. His wife named Kate. She was very busy with walking club, book club... They were both quite old, Julia missed it. She thought they were the same age as Sam.

Julia and Sam had a holiday. They decided to went to France by train. They are both didn't good at French. Sammy would hire a car and drive himself in France. Before it, Sammy could book the train tickets and contact the car company, and they would find the place to stay together later. France would be a great idea for them.
